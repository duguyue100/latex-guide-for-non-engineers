# LaTeX Guide for None Engineers

## What this is about and isn't

+   I hope this little (not so short) README can dedicate to explaining LaTeX to non-engineers.
+   When I say the word "non-engineers", I meant a narrower sense, particularly to the people who are not 
    so comfortable with programming languages.
+   This is not a collection of syntax examples.
+   This is not for the audience that has accepted LaTeX already.

## Why LaTeX anyway?

1.  If you think you can solve all your typesetting problem in WYSIWYG word processing (such as Microsoft Word),
    you can stop reading this __now__.

2.  If you've suffered enough from those WYSIWYG word processing editor, give LaTeX a shot.

3.  So basically, editors like Microsoft Word are like Microwave that can make some quick food.
    On the other hand, LaTeX is like a giant cooking machine where you can tweak every aspect of your food
    in every possible way.

4.  It's just simply cooler that you can write your entire report in codes.

5.  If the above reasons are not enough to convince you, someone, at someday, will force you to do it
    at some point. (Emmm... maybe I could change _will_ to _would_.)

## You may want to know this before learning

1.  Yeah, you need to learn LaTeX before really using it.

2.  Yeah, the learning curve may be a little higher to people who hasn't been exposed to programming
    before.

3.  Setting up LaTeX can be a painful thing, so use online LaTeX editor like [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/signup?ref=1ee0ce8d91cb) (this promo link is just for me to earn some free spaces from Overleaf) or [ShareLaTeX](https://www.sharelatex.com/) instead.

4.  If you have Windows, the first suggestion is __remove your Windows and install a Linux
    distribution__. But if you love your Windows, install MikTeX.

5.  If you are on `*nix` environment, install TeXLive.

6.  The best way of learning LaTeX is using it.

7.  You don't need to read a book about LaTeX to learn how to use LaTeX. FYI, you do have Google on your
    side, and ... Google can take some very vague search queries.
